# SVG to React Component CLI

This command-line interface (CLI) tool converts SVG files into React components from your current folder.
It allows developers to easily import SVG icons into their React projects.

## Quick start

Go to your folder with your list of svgs and run:

```
cd paths/to/your/svg/files
npx iconos
```

## Installation (optional) if you want to use the cli without npx.

To use this tool, you must first install it by running the following commands:

```
npm install -g iconos
```

## Usage

Once the tool is installed, you can run the following command in the folder containing your SVG files:

```
iconos
```

This command will convert all SVG files in the current folder into React components and save them in a new folder called Iconos.
